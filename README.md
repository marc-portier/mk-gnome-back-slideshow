#About this project
This simple small program just creates a wall-list.xml file that can be used to transform the gnome-shell background in a slideshow of the selected images.

Use the gnome-tweak-tool to then set the location of the file as the to be used image-definition.

#Usage
```
node index.js [-s showtimemillis] [-t transitiontimemillis] [-o outputname.xml] file1.jpg file2.jpg [more_files.jpg ...]
```
